# Password Generator

## The Goal

Create a password generator, using javascript, that imitates provided example. 
Generator should create a password of the desired length between 8 and 128 characters, using only the selected character types.

## What I've Done

Imitated example to the best of my ability, by building on the existing code. Added a prompt that asks for character length and types, 
a function that builds the character array based on user input, and generates the password itself.
Password is then written to the site. 

Commented out the script to make it easy to follow, and organised the css. 

Bonus: 
Generator wipes previously generated password and character array when generating a new password. So you can use it to generate multiple!
Also added a clear button to wipe the password on command. I also centered "Generate a Password" because it was bugging meeee.

## Usage
